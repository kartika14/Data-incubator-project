# Social media companies have an enormous influence on our social and political environment. 
# In the developing world, especially in countries where dissent is not voiced openly, social media can serve as a tool to understand the mood and opinion of the public. 
# In Middle East and North Africa (MENA), while internet penetration is only 58.7 percent, well below the OECD countries, social media uptake among internet users is very high. 
# Almost 100 percent of internet users in Tunisia and Algeria use social media, whereas only 84 percent of internet users in United States and 71 per cent of users in United Kingdom use social media.
# This project aims to understand the use of social media in MENA â€“ for what purpose are people using Facebook and twitter, 
# who are the most important networks and influencers and how do people react to messages from the government. 
# Our hypothesis or belief is that in these authoritarian countries, people are much more dynamic among themselves but not with the state. 
# I compile data on top 100 profiles in each country, to get a sense of the accounts that are the most followed and retweeted. 
# Accounts are classified as either official (politicians and public institutions), news (outlets specialized in news and individual 
# activists) and other (entertainment and advertising).
